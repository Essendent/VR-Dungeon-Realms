# VR-Dungeon-Realms
VR D&amp;D like RPG
This is currently just a graphics stress test for pc vr. To download, click the green "Code" button above and to the right and select zip.
You'll need to extract the file (hopefully you all know how to do that, if not ask and I can help).
Inside the "Test-One" file there should be an application called "VR Dungeon Realms", you should be able to double click that and it will automatically launch
the game in Oculus. I have done absolutely no editing of the world so you may find invisible walls or areas that you cannot access. Don't panic, it's a demo :P.
